## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, a basic understanding of HTML and CSS is mandatory.**

## The challenge
Build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I used everything I got from the design on Figma provided to me by the frontend challenge website..
The designs are in JPG static formats so I had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

Things like `font-family` and `font-size` were suggested to me in the `style-guide.md` file.
